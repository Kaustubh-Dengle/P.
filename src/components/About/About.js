          I am a self-taught Full Stack JavaScript Developer, specialised in
          React framework. My learning path is quite unconventional, after a
          financial engineering Master degree, I found a passion in web
          application development and I started to learn programming from
          scratch, from FreeCodeCamp to Pluralsight with a lot of sleepless
          nights. I built a solid foundation in Javascript. Here are few
          technologies I've been working with recently:
          <ul className="skills mt-3">{listSkills}</ul>
        </Col>
        <div className="profil mb-5 mt-4 ml-md-5 shadow"></div>
      </Row>
    </Container>
  );
};
